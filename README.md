### 🍌 A browser that fights back.

## What is this?

Juanita Banana is a **bare-metal browser** built entirely in Rust, currently powered by **WebKitGTK** (with a long-term goal to return to [Servo](https://servo.org) once its HTTP/2 stack matures), with one mission: **make your browsing profile a statistical impossibility.**

It is not trying to be another browser. It is trying to be the browser the surveillance economy fears.

## Philosophy

The modern web has turned the browser into a data collection terminal. Canvas APIs, WebGL, viewport metrics, font enumeration, battery levels, search queries — every detail of your session is harvested, correlated and sold. Juanita Banana does not block this silently. It fights back actively.

> *We do not pretend to waste money or harm any company.*
> *We are making the user's data profile useless as a signal.*
> *Intent: anti-fingerprinting. Not sabotage.*

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **No Google, ever** | Engine: WebKitGTK (pragmatic fallback). Not Blink. Not CEF. Not WebView2. |
| **Native binary** | Rust compiled with `-O3 -march=native`. CPU gets instructions, not a VM. |
| **Spartan by design** | No Electron. No Node. No Python. No browser decorations we didn't ask for. |
| **Privacy as offense** | We don't just block trackers. We poison their data. |
| **Render real, report fake** | DOM layout uses true viewport. JS tracking APIs see noise. |
| **User sovereignty** | You BAN a site, it's gone. Unban requires solving an equation. |

## Features

### 🛡️ Active Anti-Fingerprinting
- **Canvas:** Intercepts `toDataURL()` / `toBlob()` — trackers get a prerendered image, not your canvas
- **Viewport:** `screen.*` and `window.inner*` report randomized dimensions. Layout is unaffected.
- **Timezone:** `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` is overwritten to a neutral value (UTC) to prevent geographical location leaks.
- **WebGL:** Vendor/renderer strings replaced with Juanita Banana GPU
- **Navigator:** hardwareConcurrency, deviceMemory, platform — all spoofed
- **User-Agent:** Honest by default (`JuanitaBanana/0.1`). In the future, a config toggle will allow switching to a rotating mode that cycles daily through a curated list of genuine, modern User-Agents to blend into the crowd perfectly.

### 🔍 Search Profile Obfuscation
- Every real search fires 20 background searches from a heterogeneous pool
- Future: P2P gossip protocol — your fake searches are real searches from other users

### 📣 Ad Profile Obfuscation
- Ads are hidden from view but interacted with in background
- If you click on everything, you are nobody
- **Anti-Ad Blockers (Full-Screen Ads):** Replaces aggressive ad-block walls with a warning banner, respecting internal site timers to prevent breaking functionality while refusing to show the ad itself.

### 🚫 The Ban System
- One click BAN from the navbar
- Banned sites load a local HTML page: *"Go look for greener pastures elsewhere."*
- To unban: solve a math equation. No easy toggles.
- **Toxic Websites:** Marks highly suspect sites with intrusive visual elements (Marquees and semi-transparent "Guilt Trip Overlays" like Fake News memes) to constantly remind the user of their poor choices without fully blocking access.

### 🤖 AI Slop Detection
- Detects AI-generated content disclosures → injects warning in the article title

### 🔮 Future Arsenal
GTM poisoning · Meta Pixel contamination · Cookie garbage fill · Beacon API interception · Tor integration · Password manager · P2P search pool · GDPR Aggressive Unsubscribe

## Stack

```
juanita-banana
├── Engine:    WebKitGTK — Pragmatic, production-ready fallback for HTTP/2 SPAs
├── Meta:      Return to Servo once its experimental network stack matures
├── Window:    GTK3      — cross-platform, native UI
└── Spoofing:  UserContentManager — injects noise into WebKit's JS runtime
```

## Build

Builds are extremely fast since we are dynamically linking to your system's GTK3 and WebKit2GTK libraries.

```bash
# Prerequisites (Fedora)
sudo dnf install -y webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel gcc-c++ make cmake pkgconf-pkg-config openssl-devel clang-devel

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Build
source ~/.cargo/env
cargo build --release

# Run
./target/release/juanita-banana
```

## Why WebKitGTK and not Gecko/Blink?

| Engine | Language | Our take |
|---|---|---|
| **Blink** (Chrome) | C++ | Google's engine. Absolutely not. |
| **Gecko** (Firefox) | C++ + Rust | No public embedding API for desktop. |
| **Servo** | **Rust** | Linux Foundation. Our true long-term goal. Currently shelved due to critical HTTP/2 `SendRequest` bugs with modern SPAs. |
| **WebKitGTK** | C++ | Apple/GNOME engine. Pragmatic, open-source fallback. Fast and reliable. |
